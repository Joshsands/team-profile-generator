## Project Description
* The above snapshot shows an example of what the profile will look like after the user answers all the questions. The video link shows a full demonstration on how this application works. The application prompts a user for information about their team which will then add an individual card with that team member's information.

## Installation Instructions
* Pull the Github repository to your local drive, open it in an IDE and enter "npm install inquirer" in the terminal to install the inquirer node modules in the root folder. You will also need to enter "npm install jest" if you want to run the tests.

## Usage Information
* Open terminal to the root directory and enter "node app" and answer the prompts that follow. After answering all the questions, the index.html file will generate with a card for each member entered.
